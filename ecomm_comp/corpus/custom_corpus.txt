A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.

Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii). Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK. Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).  Rose absolute: Rosa alba L., Rosa centifolia L., Rosa damascena Mill., Rosa gallica L., and vars. of these spp. Rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto Rose buds Rose flowers Rose fruit (hips) Rose leaves: Rosa spp.  Medicine The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses. Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist. Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae. Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

(1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa (), in the family rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia, with smaller numbers native to europe, north america, and northwestern africa. species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  history file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there, it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  etymology the name rose comes from latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from oscan, from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi), related to avestan varəδa, sogdian ward, parthian wâr.  botany the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so. the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect-pollinated in nature. the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  evolution the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th-century china. among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.  species the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america. platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china. bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india. caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa. carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america. chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma. gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe. gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia. laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china. pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe. rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white, pink,

The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from persia to the entire world they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century from there, it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from oscan, from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi), related to avestan varəδa, sogdian ward, parthian wâr

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so
the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four) these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes roses are insect-pollinated in nature
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination the hips of most species are red, but a few (eg rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds
the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado roses were present in europe by the early oligocenetoday's garden roses come from 18th-century china among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china
bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa
carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america
chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china
pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe
rosa (syn sect cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa
synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers a few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii)
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries, persia, and china it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery, an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldsome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teain france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfithe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food other minor uses include candied rose petalsrose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk
under the american federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, there are only certain rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras)

medicine
the rose hip, usually from r canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin c the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine this and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth in pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersroses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist
other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered therein 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

"rose"  encyclopædia britannica (11th ed) cambridge university pressA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa () in the family Rosaceae () or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa. Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

medicine
the rose hip usually from r. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.
 ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist.
other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae.
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

chisholm hugh ed. (1911). "rose" . encyclopædia britannica (11th ed.). cambridge university press.A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa () in the family Rosaceae () or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa. Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America. Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China. Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India. Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa. Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America. Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma. Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe. Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia. Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China. Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe. Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa. Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii). Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.

The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect-pollinated in nature
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe
Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii)
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teaIn France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfiThe flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food Other minor uses include candied rose petalsRose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th-century china. among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america.
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china.
bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india.
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa.
carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america.
chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma.
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe.
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia.
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china.
pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe.
rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa.
synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii).
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries, persia, and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery, an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk.
under the american federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, there are only certain rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras).

medicine
the rose hip, usually from r. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad, aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis, who is identified with venus, instructs the main character, lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire, the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.
 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist.
other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae.
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

chisholm, hugh, ed. (1911). "rose" . encyclopædia britannica (11th ed.). cambridge university press.A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses. Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist. Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.

and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.  perfume rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  food and drink rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous

roses are an ingredient.  art and symbolism the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad, aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis, who is identified with venus, instructs the main character, lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire, the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.  ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses. roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses. henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist. other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.  pests and diseases wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae. cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect-pollinated in nature
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red, but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe
Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii)
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England

chisholm, hugh, ed (1911) "rose"  encyclopædia britannica (11th ed) cambridge university pressA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect-pollinated in nature The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red, but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose) Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii) Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teaIn France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfiThe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food Other minor uses include candied rose petalsRose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)  Rose absolute: Rosa alba L, Rosa centifolia L, Rosa damascena Mill, Rosa gallica L, and vars of these spp Rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto Rose buds Rose flowers Rose fruit (hips) Rose leaves: Rosa spp  Medicine The rose hip, usually from R canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

Chisholm Hugh ed. (1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa () in the family rosaceae () or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia with smaller numbers native to europe north america and northwestern africa. species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi) related to avestan varəδa sogdian ward parthian wâr.

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
the sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th-century china. among the old chinese garden roses the old blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia rosa persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america.
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china.
bracteatae – three species two from china and one from india.
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa.
carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america.
chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma.
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe.
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia.
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china.
pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe.
rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa.
synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae. Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

(1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa () in the family rosaceae () or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia with smaller numbers native to europe north america and northwestern africa. species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  history file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  etymology the name rose comes from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi) related to avestan varəδa sogdian ward parthian wâr.  botany the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so. the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect-pollinated in nature. the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds. the sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  evolution the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th-century china. among the old chinese garden roses the old blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.  species the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia rosa persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america. platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china. bracteatae – three species two from china and one from india. caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa. carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america. chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma. gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe. gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia. laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china. pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe. rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa. synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  uses roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  ornamental plants the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii). ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries persia and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.  cut flowers roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.  perfume rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  food and drink rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk.

hip usually from r. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.  art and symbolism the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.  ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses. roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses. henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist. other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and

in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldsome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teain france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfithe flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food other minor uses include candied rose petalsrose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk

medicine
the rose hip usually from r canina is used as a minor source of vitamin c the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth in pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityfollowing the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity
 ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersroses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist
other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered therein 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

chisholm hugh ed (1911) "rose"  encyclopædia britannica (11th ed) cambridge university pressA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa () in the family Rosaceae () or the flower it bears There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect-pollinated in nature The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose) Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii) Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known

Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose

Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.

Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii). Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK. Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).  Rose absolute: Rosa alba L., Rosa centifolia L., Rosa damascena Mill., Rosa gallica L., and vars. of these spp. Rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto Rose buds Rose flowers Rose fruit (hips) Rose leaves: Rosa spp.  Medicine The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses. Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist. Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae. Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

(1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa (), in the family rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia, with smaller numbers native to europe, north america, and northwestern africa. species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  history file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there, it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  etymology the name rose comes from latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from oscan, from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi), related to avestan varəδa, sogdian ward, parthian wâr.  botany the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so. the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect-pollinated in nature. the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  evolution the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th-century china. among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.  species the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america. platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china. bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india. caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa. carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america. chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma. gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe. gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia. laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china. pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe. rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white, pink,

The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from persia to the entire world they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century from there, it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from oscan, from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi), related to avestan varəδa, sogdian ward, parthian wâr

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so
the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four) these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes roses are insect-pollinated in nature
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination the hips of most species are red, but a few (eg rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds
the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado roses were present in europe by the early oligocenetoday's garden roses come from 18th-century china among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china
bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa
carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america
chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china
pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe
rosa (syn sect cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa
synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers a few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii)
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries, persia, and china it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery, an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldsome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teain france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfithe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food other minor uses include candied rose petalsrose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk
under the american federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, there are only certain rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras)

medicine
the rose hip, usually from r canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin c the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine this and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth in pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersroses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist
other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered therein 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

"rose"  encyclopædia britannica (11th ed) cambridge university pressA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa () in the family Rosaceae () or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa. Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

medicine
the rose hip usually from r. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.
 ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist.
other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae.
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

chisholm hugh ed. (1911). "rose" . encyclopædia britannica (11th ed.). cambridge university press.A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa () in the family Rosaceae () or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa. Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America. Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China. Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India. Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa. Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America. Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma. Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe. Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia. Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China. Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe. Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa. Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii). Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.

The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect-pollinated in nature
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe
Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii)
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teaIn France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfiThe flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food Other minor uses include candied rose petalsRose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th-century china. among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america.
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china.
bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india.
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa.
carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america.
chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma.
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe.
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia.
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china.
pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe.
rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa.
synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii).
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries, persia, and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery, an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk.
under the american federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, there are only certain rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras).

medicine
the rose hip, usually from r. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad, aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis, who is identified with venus, instructs the main character, lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire, the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.
 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist.
other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae.
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

chisholm, hugh, ed. (1911). "rose" . encyclopædia britannica (11th ed.). cambridge university press.A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses. Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist. Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.

and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.  perfume rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  food and drink rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous

roses are an ingredient.  art and symbolism the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad, aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis, who is identified with venus, instructs the main character, lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire, the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.  ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses. roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses. henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist. other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.  pests and diseases wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae. cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect-pollinated in nature
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red, but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe
Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii)
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England

chisholm, hugh, ed (1911) "rose"  encyclopædia britannica (11th ed) cambridge university pressA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect-pollinated in nature The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red, but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose) Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii) Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teaIn France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfiThe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food Other minor uses include candied rose petalsRose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)  Rose absolute: Rosa alba L, Rosa centifolia L, Rosa damascena Mill, Rosa gallica L, and vars of these spp Rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto Rose buds Rose flowers Rose fruit (hips) Rose leaves: Rosa spp  Medicine The rose hip, usually from R canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

Chisholm Hugh ed. (1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa () in the family rosaceae () or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia with smaller numbers native to europe north america and northwestern africa. species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi) related to avestan varəδa sogdian ward parthian wâr.

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
the sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th-century china. among the old chinese garden roses the old blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia rosa persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america.
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china.
bracteatae – three species two from china and one from india.
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa.
carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america.
chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma.
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe.
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia.
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china.
pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe.
rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa.
synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae. Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

(1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa () in the family rosaceae () or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia with smaller numbers native to europe north america and northwestern africa. species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  history file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  etymology the name rose comes from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd- (wurdi) related to avestan varəδa sogdian ward parthian wâr.  botany the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so. the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect-pollinated in nature. the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds. the sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  evolution the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th-century china. among the old chinese garden roses the old blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.  species the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia rosa persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america. platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china. bracteatae – three species two from china and one from india. caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa. carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america. chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from china and burma. gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe. gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia. laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china. pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe. rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa. synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  uses roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  ornamental plants the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii). ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries persia and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.  cut flowers roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.  perfume rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  food and drink rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk.

hip usually from r. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.  art and symbolism the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.  ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses. roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses. henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist. other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and

in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldsome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'rose absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour the weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l-citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil β-damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teain france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfithe flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food other minor uses include candied rose petalsrose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk

medicine
the rose hip usually from r canina is used as a minor source of vitamin c the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth in pre-modern medicine diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" the second-century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityfollowing the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity
 ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersroses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements the luxembourg-born belgian artist and botanist pierre-joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses
henri fantin-latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses the rose 'fantin-latour' was named after the artist
other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre-auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered therein 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

chisholm hugh ed (1911) "rose"  encyclopædia britannica (11th ed) cambridge university pressA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa () in the family Rosaceae () or the flower it bears There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect-pollinated in nature The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th-century China Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose) Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii) Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known

Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose

Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii). Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK. Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).  Rose absolute: Rosa alba L., Rosa centifolia L., Rosa damascena Mill., Rosa gallica L., and vars. of these spp. Rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto Rose buds Rose flowers Rose fruit (hips) Rose leaves: Rosa spp.  Medicine The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses. Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist. Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae. Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

(1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa (), in the family rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia, with smaller numbers native to europe, north america, and northwestern africa. species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  history file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there, it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  etymology the name rose comes from latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from oscan, from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from old persian wrd  (wurdi), related to avestan varəδa, sogdian ward, parthian wâr.  botany the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so. the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect pollinated in nature. the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  evolution the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th century china. among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.  species the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america. platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china. bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india. caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa. carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america. chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from china and burma. gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe. gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia. laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china. pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe. rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa. synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  uses roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from persia to the entire world they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century from there, it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from oscan, from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from old persian wrd  (wurdi), related to avestan varəδa, sogdian ward, parthian wâr

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so
the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four) these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes roses are insect pollinated in nature
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination the hips of most species are red, but a few (eg rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds
the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado roses were present in europe by the early oligocenetoday's garden roses come from 18th century china among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china
bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa
carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america
chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from china and burma
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china
pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe
rosa (syn sect cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa
synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers a few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii)
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries, persia, and china it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery, an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldsome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teain france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfithe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food other minor uses include candied rose petalsrose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk
under the american federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, there are only certain rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras)

medicine
the rose hip, usually from r canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin c the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine this and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth in pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol in ancient greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite in the iliad, aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis, who is identified with venus, instructs the main character, lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityfollowing the christianization of the roman empire, the rose became identified with the virgin mary the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity
 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersroses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses
henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist
other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered therein 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

"rose"  encyclopædia britannica (11th ed) cambridge university pressA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa () in the family Rosaceae () or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa. Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.
 ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist.
other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae.
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

chisholm hugh ed. (1911). "rose" . encyclopædia britannica (11th ed.). cambridge university press.A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa () in the family Rosaceae () or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa. Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America. Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China. Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India. Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa. Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America. Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma. Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe. Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia. Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China. Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe. Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa. Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii). Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK. Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).  Rose absolute: Rosa alba L. Rosa centifolia L. Rosa damascena Mill. Rosa gallica L. and vars. of these spp. Rose (otto of roses attar of roses): Ditto Rose buds Rose flowers Rose fruit (hips) Rose leaves: Rosa spp.  Medicine The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.

Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses. Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.

The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th century China Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe
Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii)
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teaIn France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfiThe flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food Other minor uses include candied rose petalsRose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd  (wurdi) related to avestan varəδa sogdian ward parthian wâr

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so
the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four) these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes roses are insect pollinated in nature
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination the hips of most species are red but a few (eg rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds
the sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii).
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries, persia, and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery, an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk.
under the american federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, there are only certain rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras).

medicine
the rose hip, usually from r. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad, aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis, who is identified with venus, instructs the main character, lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire, the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.
 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist.
other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae.
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

chisholm, hugh, ed. (1911). "rose" . encyclopædia britannica (11th ed.). cambridge university press.A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America. Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China. Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India. Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa. Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America. Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma. Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe. Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia. Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China. Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe. Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa. Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect pollinated in nature
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red, but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th century China Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe
Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii)
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teaIn France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfiThe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food Other minor uses include candied rose petalsRose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

red roses are an ingredient  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd  (wurdi) related to avestan varəδa sogdian ward parthian wâr.

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect pollinated in nature.
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
the sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th century china. among the old chinese garden roses the old blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia rosa persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america.
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china.
bracteatae – three species two from china and one from india.
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa.
carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america.
chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from china and burma.
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe.
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia.
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china.
pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe.
rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa.
synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii).
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries persia and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk.
under the american federal food drug and cosmetic act there are only certain rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras).

sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  evolution the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th century china. among the old chinese garden roses the old blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.  species the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia rosa persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america. platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china. bracteatae – three species two from china and one from india. caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa. carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america. chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from china and burma. gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe. gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia. laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china. pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe. rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa. synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  uses roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  ornamental plants the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii). ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries persia and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.  cut flowers roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.  perfume rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  food and drink rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk.

herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre modern medicine diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.  art and symbolism the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.  ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses. roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses. henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist. other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.  pests and diseases wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae. cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.  see also adr rose list of award

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect pollinated in nature
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds

the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityfollowing the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity
 ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersroses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses
henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist
other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered therein 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii) Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa (), in the family rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia, with smaller numbers native to europe, north america, and northwestern africa. species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there, it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from oscan, from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from old persian wrd  (wurdi), related to avestan varəδa, sogdian ward, parthian wâr.

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect pollinated in nature.
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th century china. among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america.
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china.
bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india.
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa.
carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america.
chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from china and burma.
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe.
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia.
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china.
pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe.

Rose absolute: Rosa alba L., Rosa centifolia L., Rosa damascena Mill., Rosa gallica L., and vars. of these spp. Rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto Rose buds Rose flowers Rose fruit (hips) Rose leaves: Rosa spp.  Medicine The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.  Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses. Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist. Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae. Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

(1911). "Rose" . Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.a rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus rosa (), in the family rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. there are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia, with smaller numbers native to europe, north america, and northwestern africa. species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  history file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there, it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  etymology the name rose comes from latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from oscan, from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from old persian wrd  (wurdi), related to avestan varəδa, sogdian ward, parthian wâr.  botany the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so. the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect pollinated in nature. the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  evolution the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th century china. among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.  species the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america. platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china. bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india. caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa. carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america. chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from china and burma. gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe. gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia. laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china. pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe. rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa. synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  uses roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  ornamental plants the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii). ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries, persia, and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery, an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.  cut flowers roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.  perfume rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  food and drink rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous

the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination the hips of most species are red, but a few (eg rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds
the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado roses were present in europe by the early oligocenetoday's garden roses come from 18th century china among the old chinese garden roses, the old blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia, rosa persica and rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata, from north america
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia, rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china
bracteatae – three species, two from china and one from india
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia, europe and north africa
carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from north america
chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from china and burma
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa), others in east asia
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china
pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from asia and europe
rosa (syn sect cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa
synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers a few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii)
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries, persia, and china it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery, an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
in temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldsome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india, and more recently into eastern europe in bulgaria, iran and germany, damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern, persian, and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teain france, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals in the indian subcontinent, rooh afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfithe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food other minor uses include candied rose petalsrose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk
under the american federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, there are only certain rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras)

rose absolute: rosa alba l, rosa centifolia l, rosa damascena mill, rosa gallica l, and vars of these spp
rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): ditto
rose buds
rose flowers
rose fruit (hips)
rose leaves: rosa spp

medicine
the rose hip, usually from r canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin c the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine this and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth in pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol in ancient greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite in the iliad, aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis, who is identified with venus, instructs the main character, lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityfollowing the christianization of the roman empire, the rose became identified with the virgin mary the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity
 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersroses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses
henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist
other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered therein 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

chisholm, hugh, ed (1911) "rose"  encyclopædia britannica (11th ed) cambridge university pressA rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect pollinated in nature The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red, but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's

There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia with smaller numbers native to Europe North America and northwestern Africa. Species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America. Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China. Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India. Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa. Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America. Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma. Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe. Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia. Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China. Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe. Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa. Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii). Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK. Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).  Rose absolute: Rosa alba L. Rosa centifolia L. Rosa damascena Mill. Rosa gallica L. and vars. of these spp. Rose (otto of roses attar of roses): Ditto Rose buds Rose flowers Rose fruit (hips) Rose leaves: Rosa spp.  Medicine The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.  Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses. Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist. Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae. Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

thousands of cultivars. they form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. most species are native to asia with smaller numbers native to europe north america and northwestern africa. species cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. rose plants range in size from compact miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. different species hybridize easily and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  history file:rosa sulfurea

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd  (wurdi) related to avestan varəδa sogdian ward parthian wâr

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so
the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four) these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes roses are insect pollinated in nature
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination the hips of most species are red but a few (eg rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds
the sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado roses were present in europe by the early oligocenetoday's garden roses come from 18th century china among the old chinese garden roses the old blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia rosa persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china
bracteatae – three species two from china and one from india
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa
carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america
chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from china and burma
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china
pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe
rosa (syn sect cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa
synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers a few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii)
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries persia and china it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldsome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teain france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfithe flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food other minor uses include candied rose petalsrose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk

flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

medicine
the rose hip, usually from r. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad, aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis, who is identified with venus, instructs the main character, lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire, the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.
 ever since the 1400s, the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s, the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist.
other impressionists including claude monet, paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the rosaceae.
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

chisholm, hugh, ed. (1911). "rose" . encyclopædia britannica (11th ed.). cambridge university press.A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.  Roses have acquired cultural significance in  many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.  History File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.  Etymology The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.  Botany The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules. Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America. Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose). Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections. Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China. Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India. Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa. Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America. Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma. Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe. Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia. Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China. Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe. Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa. Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii). Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals. In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK. Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship, roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded, reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there, it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect pollinated in nature
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red, but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th century China Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China
Bracteatae – three species, two from China and one from India
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa
Carolinae – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America
Chinensis – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa), others in east Asia
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China
Pimpinellifoliae – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe
Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa
Synstylae – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii)
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C, are edible raw, and occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup, or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teaIn France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfiThe flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases) The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food Other minor uses include candied rose petalsRose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)

Medicine
The rose hip, usually from R canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems

prickles on the underside of the stem most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so the flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of rosa sericea, which usually has only four each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea, four) these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes roses are insect pollinated in nature the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination the hips of most species are red, but a few (eg rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin c, among the richest sources of any plant the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds the sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) despite the presence of

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001.JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world. They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time. The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century. From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr.

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect pollinated in nature.
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.Today's garden roses come from 18th century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America.
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India.
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa.
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma.
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia.
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China.
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
Rosa (syn. sect. Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers
Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

Perfume
Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink
Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.In France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.The flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act there are only certain Rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Medicine
The rose hip usually from R. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism
The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

Pests and diseases
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae.
Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

history
file:rosa sulfurea 001.jpg
considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from persia to the entire world. they remained native to persia and its nearby territories for a long time. the yellow persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching vienna sometime in the 16th century. from there it slowly gained prominence across europe and the world for its color and fragrance.

etymology
the name rose comes from latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from oscan from greek ῥόδον rhódon (aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from old persian wrd  (wurdi) related to avestan varəδa sogdian ward parthian wâr.

botany
the leaves are borne alternately on the stem. in most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from southeast asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
the flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of rosa sericea which usually has only four. each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red. beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some rosa sericea four). these may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. there are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. roses are insect pollinated in nature.
the aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip. many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. the hips of most species are red but a few (e.g. rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs. rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (rosa canina) and rugosa rose (rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin c among the richest sources of any plant. the hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds.
the sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems. rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. some species such as rosa rugosa and rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer. a few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

evolution
the oldest remains of roses are from the late eocene florissant formation of colorado. roses were present in europe by the early oligocene.today's garden roses come from 18th century china. among the old chinese garden roses the old blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse.

species
the genus rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
hulthemia (formerly simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest asia rosa persica and rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
hesperrhodos (from the greek for "western rose") contains rosa minutifolia and rosa stellata from north america.
platyrhodon (from the greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east asia rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called eurosa) containing all the other roses. this subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from china.
bracteatae – three species two from china and one from india.
caninae – pink and white flowered species from asia europe and north africa.
carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from north america.
chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from china and burma.
gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western asia and europe.
gymnocarpae – one species in western north america (rosa gymnocarpa) others in east asia.
laevigatae – a single white flowered species from china.
pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from asia and europe.
rosa (syn. sect. cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but north africa.
synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

uses
roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. they have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

ornamental plants
the majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. a few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as rosa glauca and rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as rosa moyesii).
ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 bc in mediterranean countries persia and china. it is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.
in the early 19th century the empress josephine of france patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at malmaison. as long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by loddiges nursery for abney park cemetery an early victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in england.

cut flowers
roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
in temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.

perfume
rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

food and drink
rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose petals.rose creams (rose flavoured fondant covered in chocolate often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional english confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the uk.
under the american federal food drug and cosmetic act there are only certain rosa species varieties and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (gras).

medicine
the rose hip usually from r. canina is used as a minor source of vitamin c. the fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. rosa chinensis has long been used in chinese traditional medicine. this and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. in pre modern medicine diarrhodon (gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

art and symbolism
the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.
 ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses.
roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses.
henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist.
other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.

pests and diseases
wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae.
cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. in many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses.  perfume rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. an associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices. the production technique originated in persia and then spread through arabia and india and more recently into eastern europe. in bulgaria iran and germany damask roses (rosa × damascena 'trigintipetala') are used. in other parts of the world rosa × centifolia is commonly used. the oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour. 'rose absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour. the weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil. the main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and l citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil. β damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.  food and drink rose hips are high in vitamin c are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea. they are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products.  rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in middle eastern persian and south asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat. rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. a sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the indian subcontinent. the leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.in france there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. in the indian subcontinent rooh afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.the flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). the latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. other minor uses include candied rose

the long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. in ancient greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess aphrodite. in the iliad aphrodite protects the body of hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic greek lyric poet ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms". the second century ad greek travel writer pausanias associates the rose with the story of adonis and states that the rose is red because aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. book eleven of the ancient roman novel the golden ass by apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess isis who is identified with venus instructs the main character lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.following the christianization of the roman empire the rose became identified with the virgin mary. the colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. the rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in christianity.  ever since the 1400s the franciscans have had a crown rosary of the seven joys of the blessed virgin mary. in the 1400s and 1500s the carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. albrecht dürer's painting the feast of the rosary (1506) depicts the virgin mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.roses symbolised the houses of york and lancaster in a conflict known as the wars of the roses. roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements. the luxembourg born belgian artist and botanist pierre joseph redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses. henri fantin latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses. the rose 'fantin latour' was named after the artist. other impressionists including claude monet paul cézanne and pierre auguste renoir have paintings of roses among their works. in the 19th century for example artists associated the city of trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol. it was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered there.in 1986 president ronald reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the united states.  pests and diseases wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. many of these affect other plants including other genera of the rosaceae. cultivated roses are often subject

History
File:Rosa sulfurea 001JPG
Considered a symbol of love and friendship roses were a gift from Persia to the entire world They remained native to Persia and its nearby territories for a long time The yellow Persian rose was the first variety of the flower to be traded reaching Vienna sometime in the 16th century From there it slowly gained prominence across Europe and the world for its color and fragrance

Etymology
The name rose comes from Latin rosa which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον wródon) itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd  (wurdi) related to Avestan varəδa Sogdian ward Parthian wâr

Botany
The leaves are borne alternately on the stem In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (20 to 59 in) long pinnate with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so
The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect pollinated in nature
The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds
The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points

Evolution
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th century China Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse

Species
The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:
Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules
Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America
Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose)
Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections
Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China
Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India
Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa
Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America
Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma
Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe
Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia
Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China
Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe
Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa
Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas

Uses
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization

Ornamental plants
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii)
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England

with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so The flowers of most species have five petals with the exception of Rosa sericea which usually has only four Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink though in a few species yellow or red Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea four) These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes Roses are insect pollinated in nature The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry like structure called a rose hip Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination The hips of most species are red but a few (eg Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer the hypanthium which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine but stiff hairs Rose hips of some species especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa) are very rich in vitamin C among the richest sources of any plant The hips are eaten by fruit eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings which then disperse the seeds in their droppings Some birds particularly finches also eat the seeds The sharp growths along a rose stem though commonly called "thorns" are technically prickles outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem) unlike true thorns which are modified stems Rose prickles are typically sickle shaped hooks which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes) Despite the presence of prickles roses are frequently browsed by deer A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points  Evolution The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado Roses were present in Europe by the early OligoceneToday's garden roses come from 18th century China Among the old Chinese garden roses the Old Blush group is the most primitive while newer groups are the most diverse  Species The genus Rosa is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera: Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata from North America Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose" referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose) Rosa (the type subgenus sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections Banksianae – white and yellow flowered roses from China Bracteatae – three species two from China and one from India Caninae – pink and white flowered species from Asia Europe and North Africa Carolinae – white pink and bright pink flowered species all from North America Chinensis – white pink yellow red and mixed colour roses from China and Burma Gallicanae – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe Gymnocarpae – one species in western North America (Rosa gymnocarpa) others in east Asia Laevigatae – a single white flowered species from China Pimpinellifoliae – white pink bright yellow mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe Rosa (syn sect Cinnamomeae) – white pink lilac mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa Synstylae – white pink and crimson flowered roses from all areas  Uses Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops Some are used as landscape plants for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization  Ornamental plants The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers A few mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa) ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii) Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries Persia and China It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants Most are double flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England  Cut flowers Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale In temperate climates cut roses are often grown in greenhouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the worldSome kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water like rainbow roses  Perfume Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses) which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking cosmetics medicine and religious practices The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India and more recently into eastern Europe In Bulgaria Iran and Germany damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used In other parts of the world Rosa × centifolia is commonly used The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow grey in colour 'Rose Absolute' is solvent extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil dark yellow to orange in colour The weight of oil extracted is about one three thousandth to one six thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L citronellol and rose camphor an odorless solid composed of alkanes which separates from rose oil β Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent  Food and drink Rose hips are high in vitamin C are edible raw and occasionally made into jam  jelly marmalade and soup or are brewed for tea They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil which is used in skin products and some makeup products  Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern Persian and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight barfi baklava halva gulab jamun knafeh and nougat Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make teaIn France there is much use of rose syrup most commonly made from an extract of rose petals In the Indian subcontinent Rooh Afza a concentrated  squash made with roses is popular as are rose flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfiThe flower stems and young shoots are edible as are the petals (sans the white

many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine This and other species have been used for stomach problems and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth In pre modern medicine diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον "compound of roses" from ῥόδων "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient  Art and symbolism The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol In ancient Greece the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite In the Iliad Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms" The second century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis who is identified with Venus instructs the main character Lucius who has been transformed into a donkey to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanityFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity  Ever since the 1400s the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary In the 1400s and 1500s the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens Albrecht Dürer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippersRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits illustrations on stamps as ornaments or as architectural elements The Luxembourg born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers particularly roses Henri Fantin Latour was also a prolific painter of still life particularly flowers including roses The rose 'Fantin Latour' was named after the artist Other impressionists including Claude Monet Paul Cézanne and Pierre Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works In the 19th century for example artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose and this rose developed as the city's symbol It was not until 2021 that the rose which was believed to be extinct was rediscovered thereIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States  Pests and diseases Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases Many of these affect other plants including other genera of the Rosaceae Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect arachnid and fungal pests and diseases In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems  See also ADR rose List of Award of Garden Merit roses List of rose cultivars named after people Rose (colour) Rose garden Rose Hall of Fame
